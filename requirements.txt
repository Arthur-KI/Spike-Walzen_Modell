How to Use

The entire training setup is self-contained in a single script.
1. Setup
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start Training

To start a new training run from scratch, simply execute the main script:
python SpikeWalze_V3_Sprachmodell_Wiki_Circulum_Training.py

3. Resume from a Checkpoint

To resume training from a saved checkpoint, edit the config dictionary at the bottom of the script:
config = {
    # ...
    # Set the path to your checkpoint file here
    'model_path': 'checkpoints/model_epoch_100.pt' 
}
